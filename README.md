# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose of the PyBer Analysis was to analyze the correlation between [city data](https://github.com/fobordo/PyBer_Analysis/blob/64873e609f3add2b33a784bcc7ed44bafcd6cae9/Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride data](https://github.com/fobordo/PyBer_Analysis/blob/64873e609f3add2b33a784bcc7ed44bafcd6cae9/Resources/ride_data.csv) through the creation of compelling visualizations in order to to help the company improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Python scripts were written using Pandas libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that demonstrate the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.

## Results:
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

There is a description of the differences in the ride-sharing data for ALL SIX metrics by city type.
